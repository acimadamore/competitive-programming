# Competitive Programming

Solutions to programming contest problems from different online judges.

I solve this problems for practicing my problem solving skills, learn about new topics and for fun. In every solution i try to write the most understandable and legible code, even if that takes many revisions, so these are not the result of timed training sessions.

There's one folder for every online judge. Inside each folder there's a text file for every problem. `template.cpp` in the root folder is a C++ template.

Unless it's specified otherwise, every problem has been "Accepted" by the judge.

Every file has a header section indicating the name of the problem, its URL and the topic/s that are concerned, for example: `Graphs, Shortest path, DFS(TLE), Dijkstra` indicates that the problem is about graph theory, specifically shortest path problem and it was solved using Dijkstra's algorithm, DFS(TLE) means that a Depth First Search was tried but the result was Time Limit Exceeded. Comments will be included if necessary.
